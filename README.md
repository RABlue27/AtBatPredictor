# AtBatPredictor

Welcome to AtBatPredictor, a TensorFlow model designed to predict the outcome of Major League Baseball (MLB) At-Bats (ABs). This project utilizes the `pybaseball` library to generate data and leverages Python libraries including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and TensorFlow for data analysis, visualization, and model training.

## Objective

The primary objective of AtBatPredictor is to develop an accurate model for predicting the outcomes of MLB At-Bats. By leveraging the capabilities of TensorFlow and utilizing data generated through the `pybaseball` library, we aim to enhance our understanding of baseball analytics and predictive modeling.

## Data Generation

We employed the `pybaseball` library, a Python interface for baseball statistics, to generate the necessary data for our project. This data serves as the foundation for training our TensorFlow model. The data generated includes various features and attributes related to At-Bats in MLB games.

## Libraries Used

- `pybaseball`: Used for data generation, providing a Python interface to baseball statistics and insights.
- NumPy: Employed for efficient numerical computations and array manipulation.
- Pandas: Utilized for data manipulation, preprocessing, and organization.
- Matplotlib: Utilized for data visualization, enabling insightful graphical representations.
- TensorFlow: The core library for developing, training, and evaluating our predictive model.

## Model Training

We trained our predictive model using the data generated by the `pybaseball` library. TensorFlow, a powerful machine learning library, facilitated the creation and training of the model. By leveraging its flexible architecture, we were able to optimize the model's performance through multiple training iterations.

## Usage

To use the AtBatPredictor model:

1. Install the required libraries using `pip install numpy pandas matplotlib tensorflow pybaseball`.
2. Generate or acquire MLB At-Bat data using the implementations provided.
3. Load the data into the appropriate format for training and evaluation.
4. Develop and train your TensorFlow prediction model using the provided data.
5. Evaluate the model's performance and fine-tune as needed.
6. Utilize the trained model to predict the outcomes of new, unseen At-Bats.
